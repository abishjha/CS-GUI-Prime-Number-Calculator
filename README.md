# CS-GUI-Prime-Number-Calculator

A GUI application which will allow the user to request the number of prime numbers between 2 and a user supplied value.  The code will display the result in a list box.  The application will still be responsive while the computation is being performed.  There user will have two push buttons.  One to start the calculation and the other to cancel it.


The following is a list of some of specs:

1. When the user presses the start button, gets the end point number and does error checking. A message box is shown if number is not a positive integer.

2. Disables the start button and enables the cancel button.

3. The results are calculated and recorded directly in the output list box.

4. If the user hits the cancel button, the code will abort the calculation and the start button is enabled and the cancel button disabled.
